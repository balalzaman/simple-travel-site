        <h3>The Sports</h3>
        <p>
            It is widely known that people in England simply adore football (soccer if you are an American) and there are many clubs playing in the 
            strongest league in the world (The English Premier League). So, if you are also a fan of this sport, you might consider visiting a game during 
            a weekend that you are spending there. Whether it is Wembley, Emirates, Stamford Bridge, Craven Cottage, or the newly-built Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, 
            you know that you will be treated with a fantastic atmosphere during a high-quality football match. If this isn't the sport of your choosing, you might 
            consider visiting Wimbledon for tennis or watching a rugby game. There are many more options when it comes to sports and if you are a fan, you should take that chance.

            <h3>The Nightlife</h3>
            While Londoners are hard workers, probably due to it being one of the most expensive cities to live in, they also like to relax as well, and this city pays off in this 
            matter big time. When it comes to the nightlife in London it offers anything you can imagine. You will have your fair share of options from classic London pubs, chick 
            clubs, dive bars, theatres filled with Hollywood stars, underground places with live music, outdoor live concerts of any genre you can imagine, and many more things. 
            England's capital has it all in terms of having fun at night and it seems to be one of those cities that never sleeps. If you consider yourself a night owl, you surely 
            would not miss out on an opportunity for a good night's fun in London.
